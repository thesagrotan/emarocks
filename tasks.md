# Refactor Checklist for Blob Simulation Project

## 1. Unify Utility Functions
- [x] Identified all duplicate implementations of `poissonDiskSampling` and `hexToRgba` in the codebase (in `components/utils.ts`, `components/blob-simulation/utils.ts`, and `utils.ts`).
- [x] Decided on `shared/utils.ts` as the single source of truth for these utilities.
- [x] Removed redundant implementations from all other files.
- [x] Updated all imports throughout the project to use the unified utility functions from `shared/utils.ts`.
- [x] Ensured the unified utilities are well-documented and have clear parameter/return type annotations.
- [x] Add or improve unit tests for these utilities to cover edge cases and invalid input.
- [x] Use or update barrel files (index.ts) for easier imports in shared and blob-simulation directories.

**Notes:**
- All usages of `hexToRgba` and `poissonDiskSampling` are now consistent and imported from `shared/utils.ts`.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for `hexToRgba` and `poissonDiskSampling` in `shared/utils.test.ts`.
- Created/updated barrel files `shared/index.ts` and `blob-simulation/index.ts`.
- Section 1 is complete.

## 2. Centralize Theme and Color Logic
- [x] Create a utility or React context for theme-based color selection (e.g., `getSimulationColors(params, theme)`).
- [x] Refactor all color logic in components and utilities to use this central utility/context, including all theme toggling and color selection for light/dark modes.
- [x] Ensure color logic is consistent and correct across all usages, including SVG export, canvas drawing, overlays, and UI controls.
- [x] Document the color utility/context and provide usage examples.

**Notes:**
- `getSimulationColors` utility has been created in `shared/utils.ts` and now handles all theme-based color selection
- The `ThemeToggle` component has been updated to use the centralized color utility
- Canvas rendering, SVG export, and UI components now consistently use the centralized color logic
- Comprehensive documentation added to `documentation_updates.md` with examples and implementation notes
- Section 2 is complete

## 3. Modularize Blob Initialization and Placement
- [x] Extract blob placement and initialization logic from the main simulation component into reusable functions or custom hooks (e.g., `useBlobPlacement`).
- [x] Memoize expensive calculations and derived values (e.g., letter area, mask generation, collision checks) using React or utility memoization where possible.
- [x] Add unit tests for blob placement logic, including edge cases (e.g., restricted area at edge, very small/large blob counts).
- [x] Document the new functions/hooks and provide usage examples.
- [x] Implement "Add" and "Remove" blob functionalities using canvas click events.
- [x] Integrate a font selector component into the UI to allow users to choose different fonts for the letter within the restricted area.
- [x] Ensure the selected font is correctly applied to the letter rendering on the canvas and in the SVG export.

**Notes:**
- `initializeBlobs` utility created in `blob-simulation/hooks.ts`
- `useLetterAreaCalculation` hook implemented to memoize expensive letter area calculations
- `blob-simulation.tsx` refactored to use these utilities for all blob placement and initialization
- Comprehensive unit tests added in `hooks.test.ts` to verify blob initialization logic and edge cases
- Detailed documentation added to `blob-simulation/README.md` explaining the new utilities and hooks
- Section 3 is complete

## 4. Improve State and Animation Management
- [x] Move animation frame and simulation state logic into a custom React hook (e.g., `useBlobSimulationAnimation`).
- [x] Simplify and document all state variables, ensuring each has a clear purpose and is not duplicated.
- [x] Remove any duplicated or unnecessary state logic from the main component.
- [x] Add comments explaining the animation lifecycle and state transitions.

**Notes:**
- Created `useBlobSimulationAnimation` hook in `blob-simulation/hooks.ts` that encapsulates all animation-related logic
- Added comprehensive documentation for all state variables in both the hook and main component
- Removed duplicated and unnecessary state logic from the main `BlobSimulation` component
- Added detailed comments explaining the animation lifecycle (init, start, loop, pause, parameter updates, cleanup)
- Improved performance using adaptive FPS control and spatial optimization for blob interactions
- Section 4 is complete

## 5. Component Decomposition
- [x] Split the main simulation component into smaller presentational components:
  - [x] Canvas (handles rendering and events)
  - [x] Controls (parameter sliders, toggles, etc.)
  - [x] Overlays/Indicators (live editing, tooltips, etc.)
- [x] Move each component to its own file if not already separated.
- [x] Ensure all custom components have clear and correct prop types, and document their API and expected usage.

**Notes:**
- Created `SimulationCanvas.tsx` component to handle canvas rendering and drawing logic
- Created `SimulationOverlays.tsx` component to manage all UI overlay elements
- Utilized existing `SimulationControls` component for parameter controls
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all components with clear prop types
- Decomposition greatly improved maintainability and separation of concerns
- Extracted utility functions like `drawSimulation` into appropriate component files
- Section 5 is complete

## 6. Cache and Font Handling
- [x] Centralize font family formatting and baseline calculation in a utility function (e.g., `getFontFamilyString`, `getLetterVisualBounds`).
- [x] Ensure `letterShapeCache` is cleared whenever relevant parameters (font, color, letter, size) change, to prevent stale rendering.
- [x] Add unit tests for font and cache utilities, including edge cases (e.g., unusual font names, very large/small sizes).
- [x] Document the cache and font utilities and their intended usage.

**Notes:**
- Created centralized font utility functions in `/shared/font-utils.ts` including:
  - `formatFontFamily`: Properly formats font family names for use in CSS/Canvas
  - `getLetterVisualBounds`: Calculates baseline offset for proper text centering
  - `createFontString`: Creates complete font strings for Canvas API
  - `clearLetterCache`: Handles cache invalidation
  - `isFontAvailable`: Detects if a font is available in the browser
- Added a custom React hook `useLetterCacheInvalidation` that watches for parameter changes
- Integrated cache invalidation in the BlobSimulation component and initialization function
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `/shared/font-utils.test.ts` that cover:
  - Basic functionality of all utility functions
  - Edge cases like unavailable contexts and error states
  - Validation of formatting rules for different font family names
  - Testing the cache clearing functionality
- Added detailed documentation in `documentation_updates.md` explaining the utilities and their usage
- Section 6 is complete

## 7. TypeScript Improvements
- [ ] Strengthen types for simulation parameters, blob state, and context. Use interfaces and type aliases where appropriate.
- [ ] Add or improve types in all utility functions, including explicit return types and parameter types.
- [ ] Add or improve type tests if applicable (e.g., using `tsd`).
- [ ] Ensure all exported types are documented and used consistently across the codebase.

## 8. Consistent Error Handling
- [ ] Centralize error handling and logging for simulation and utility functions (e.g., create a `logError` utility or use a context-based logger).
- [ ] Replace all inline `console.error`/`console.warn` with the new utility/context for consistency.
- [ ] Add tests for error handling where possible (e.g., simulate errors in blob placement, color parsing, etc.).
- [ ] Document the error handling approach and provide usage examples.

## 9. Documentation & Comments
- [ ] Add or improve comments and documentation for all complex logic, especially in utility and core simulation files. Use JSDoc or TypeScript doc comments where possible.
- [ ] Keep `refactor-log.txt` updated as you progress, to track what's been done and what's pending. Include dates and a brief summary for each entry.
- [ ] Ensure all README files and in-code documentation are up to date with the new structure and APIs.

**Updated:**
- The `ThemeToggle` component has been updated to use a Shadcn UI-style implementation. It features a dynamic background and icon colors based on the current theme.


# Blob Color Update Issue - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

The blob colors were not updating dynamically when changed through the simulation controls. This was due to a combination of factors:

*   **Caching in `Blob` Class:** The `Blob` class was caching the fill and stroke styles, preventing them from updating when new color values were provided.
*   **Incorrect Opacity Handling:** The opacity was not being properly applied to the blob fill color.

## Solution Implemented

*   **Dynamic Styles:** The `draw` method in the `Blob` class was modified to dynamically determine fill and stroke styles based on the provided `fillColor` and `strokeColor` arguments, removing the caching.
*   **Opacity Integration:** The `getSimulationColors` utility function was updated to calculate the `blobFill` color as an RGBA string, incorporating the `blobFillOpacity` value. The `draw` function in `BlobSimulation.tsx` was adjusted to directly pass this value to `blob.draw`.

*   **Comprehensive Color Tests:** Add unit or integration tests to verify that color changes are correctly reflected in all parts of the simulation, including canvas drawing, SVG export, and UI controls.
*   **Opacity Edge Cases:** Thoroughly test edge cases for opacity, such as very low or high opacity values, to ensure rendering is consistent.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Profile the simulation with various color changes to identify and address any performance bottlenecks, especially when many blobs are present.
*   **Color Spaces:** Consider if other color spaces (e.g., HSL) might be more suitable for dynamic color manipulation and blending in the simulation.

# Next Steps for Developers

Section 6 of the refactoring tasks (Cache and Font Handling) has been completed successfully. The key improvements include:

1. **Centralized Font Utilities**: Created a comprehensive set of font utility functions in `/shared/font-utils.ts` that handle:
   - Font family formatting (adding quotes for multi-word fonts)
   - Baseline calculation for proper text centering
   - Font string creation for Canvas API
   - Cache invalidation to prevent stale rendering
   - Font availability detection

2. **Improved Cache Management**: Implemented a React hook (`useLetterCacheInvalidation`) that watches for changes to:
   - Letter character
   - Font family
   - Letter color
   - Letter size
   And automatically clears the letter shape cache when any of these parameters change.

3. **Robust Error Handling**: Added graceful error handling in font utilities to handle edge cases like:
   - Missing or unavailable fonts
   - Canvas context not available
   - Errors during text measurement

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created unit tests that cover basic functionality and edge cases for all font utilities.

5. **Detailed Documentation**: Added extensive documentation explaining the purpose and usage of all font-related utilities.

The codebase is now ready for Section 7 (TypeScript Improvements), which will focus on strengthening types and type safety throughout the project.

Please review the changes and continue with the remaining tasks in the checklist. The font handling improvements should provide more consistent text rendering and prevent caching-related visual artifacts.
