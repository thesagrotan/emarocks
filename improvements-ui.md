# UI/UX Improvement Ideas for Control Panels

Here's a list of potential improvements for the control panel layout and user experience:

## Aesthetic Improvements

1.  `[x]` **Consistent Spacing:** Ensure uniform spacing between labels, inputs, sliders, and sections across all panels. (Largely addressed via standardized padding/margins)
2.  `[x]` **Typography Hierarchy:** Establish a clearer visual hierarchy using different font sizes/weights for titles, section headers, and labels (e.g., slightly larger section headers). (Standardized CardTitle/AccordionTrigger and Label sizes)
3.  `[x]` **Input Styling:** Standardize the height and appearance of all input fields (text, color pickers) for a cleaner look. (Standardized to h-8)
4.  `[ ]` **Slider Thumb/Track:** Consider customizing the slider thumb and track appearance to better match the overall theme. (Skipped - requires more complex CSS)
5.  `[x]` **Switch Styling:** Ensure the switch component's size and style are visually balanced with other controls. (Padding added around switch rows)
6.  `[x]` **Iconography:** Use consistent icon styles and sizes (e.g., for tooltips, play/pause). Ensure icons are crisp and clear. (Tooltip icon style adjusted)
7.  `[x]` **Card Styling:** Refine card padding, borders, and background colors (especially subtle differences between light/dark modes) for a sleeker feel. Maybe explore borderless cards with subtle shadows. (Standardized padding, using Accordion for borderless section look)
8.  `[ ]` **Color Picker:** Use a more integrated or visually appealing color picker component if possible. (Skipped - larger change)

## User Experience (UX) Improvements

1.  `[x]` **Grouping Logic:** Review the grouping of controls. Are related parameters logically placed together? (e.g., all physics settings, all style settings). (Grouping seems logical, maintained)
2.  `[x]` **Collapsible Sections:** For panels with many options, consider making sections collapsible (using Accordion components) to reduce initial visual clutter. (Implemented for Physics, Style, Container, Restricted Area)
3.  `[x]` **Clearer Tooltips:** Ensure tooltip text is concise, informative, and explains the *effect* of the parameter, not just its name. Add tooltips to less obvious controls. (Tooltips added previously, text content external)
4.  `[ ]` **Input Validation/Feedback:** Provide visual feedback for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values where numbers are expected, hex color validation). (Skipped - requires state changes)
5.  `[ ]` **Reset Defaults:** Add a "Reset to Default" button for individual sections or the entire panel. (Skipped - requires state changes)
6.  `[ ]` **Live Preview Feedback:** Enhance the "Applying changes..." indicator or provide more immediate visual feedback on the canvas when parameters are changed (if performance allows). (Skipped - requires logic changes)
7.  `[x]` **Parameter Ranges:** Clearly indicate the min/max values for sliders, possibly directly next to the slider or label. (Changed approach: Removed min/max labels, made value editable)
8.  `[ ]` **Search/Filter:** For very complex panels in the future, a search bar to quickly find a specific parameter could be useful. (Skipped - out of scope)
9.  `[ ]` **Responsive Design:** Ensure panels adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, perhaps stacking vertically on smaller screens. (Skipped - requires more layout changes)
10. `[x]` **Keyboard Navigation:** Improve accessibility by ensuring all controls are easily navigable and operable using the keyboard. (Partially addressed via editable input component handling Enter/Escape)
